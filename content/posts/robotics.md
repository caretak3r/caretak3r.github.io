Jensen Huang recently stated that robotics have yet to have their "GPT moment". What does that mean?

### **Notes**  
- **Market Caps**: Approximate values as of late 2023 (subject to change).  
- **Ownership**: Some private companies are subsidiaries of larger corporations (e.g., Boston Dynamics under Hyundai).  
- **Scope**: Robotics is often a segment within broader operations (e.g., Tesla, NVIDIA).

So many "choices" but where is the asymmetric upshot? 

Looks like the highest growth may come from hospitality/service (hotel, food, delivery), logistics (delivery, warehouse, vision) and healthcare (nursing homes, surgeries).

There are ETFs that track various "robotics" companies with higher concentrations in the MAG-7 stocks (NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, TSLA). But I believe the edge is somewhere in the middle of the larger caps and the unfamiliar small ones. 

My highest convictions are centered around companies that **already** have robotics in use and are **matured** in practice, manufacturing, and quality testing. This boils down to the following companies (_imho_): 

1. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)
2. Hyundai Motor Company (HYMTF)
3. ABB Robotics (ABB)
4. Amazon Robotics (AMZN)

Even with real world use-cases and business opportunities, I believe we have _**years**_ before robotics has a renaissance era. Hype cycles are prevalent in 2023-2025 due to the AI push, and I am approaching investments in these companies very cautiously.
