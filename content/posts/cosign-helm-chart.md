## What is Cosign?

Cosign is a tool developed by the Sigstore project that provides a simple way to sign and verify software artifacts. It's particularly useful for container images, Helm charts, and other software artifacts in the supply chain. Cosign uses keyless signing by default, which means it doesn't require you to manage private keys. Instead, it leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication and uses ephemeral keys for signing.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/)
2. [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
4. A container registry (like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or Google Container Registry)

For the purposes of this post, I am going to generate and use static keypairs, instead of keyless or any cloud provider-specific KMS implementation, but those all work as well. 

## Step 1: Signing a Docker Image

First, let's sign the Docker image that our Helm chart will use:

```bash
# Build your Docker image
docker build -t caretak3r/nginx:latest .

# Push the image to your registry
docker push caretak3r/nginx:latest

# Sign the image using Cosign
cosign sign --key cosign.key caretak3r/nginx:latest

# Sign the image digest instead of the tag
cosign sign --key cosign.key caretak3r/nginx@sha256:56874d0ec4c0c6a4a3d960bdbeda30c4ac03ef4673e7b560968293c2a04094ef
```

The output would look like this:

```

Taking a look at DockerHub (ECR, or any other OCI registries will work, too) you can see a `.sig` file was created:

When you run the `cosign sign` command for the first time, it will:
1. Open your browser for OIDC authentication
2. Generate an ephemeral key pair
3. Sign the image
4. Upload the signature to the registry

## Step 2: Signing a Helm Chart

Now, let's sign the Helm chart:

```bash
# Package your Helm chart
helm package cosign-helm-signing/

# Sign the chart using Cosign
cosign sign-blob --key cosign.key cosign-helm-signing-0.1.0.tgz --bundle cosign-helm-signing-0.1.0.tgz.sig

# Push the Helm chart to dockerHub
helm registry login registry-1.docker.io

# Push the chart
helm push cosign-helm-signing-0.1.0.tgz oci://registry-1.docker.io/caretak3r

> Pushed: registry-1.docker.io/caretak3r/cosign-helm-signing:0.1.0
> Digest: sha256:3ad510ae4d611ceb4871a061ee8a8775de78c56861a8130fef8481d5bd498e66

# Sign the chart
cosign sign-blob --key cosign.key registry-1.docker.io/caretak3r/cosign-helm-signing@sha256:3ad510ae4d611ceb4871a061ee8a8775de78c56861a8130fef8481d5bd498e66

cosign sign --key cosign.key index.docker.io/caretak3r/cosign-helm-signing@sha256:3ad510ae4d611ceb4871a061ee8a8775de78c56861a8130fef8481d5bd498e66
```

Output for signing the blob looks like this: 

```plaintext

The `--bundle` flag creates a signature bundle that includes the signature and the certificate.

## Step 3: Verifying Signatures

### Verifying Docker Image

```bash
# Verify the Docker image signature
cosign verify --key cosign.pub caretak3r/nginx@sha256:56874d0ec4c0c6a4a3d960bdbeda30c4ac03ef4673e7b560968293c2a04094ef
```

Output for verification would look like this: 

```plaintext

The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key

```

```bash

```

## Step 4: Using Signed Helm Charts

To use a signed Helm chart, you can add the signature verification to your Helm installation:

```bash
# Install the chart with signature verification
helm install my-release cosign-helm-signing-0.1.0.tgz --verify --signature cosign-helm-signing-0.1.0.tgz.sig
```

## Best Practices

1. **Automate the Process**: Integrate signing into your CI/CD pipeline
2. **Use Keyless Signing**: Leverage OIDC for authentication instead of managing private keys
3. **Verify Signatures**: Always verify signatures before deploying
4. **Document Your Process**: Keep track of your signing process and requirements
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep Cosign and other tools updated to the latest versions

## Additional Tips

- You can use Cosign's key management features if you prefer traditional key-based signing
- Consider using [Rekor](https://docs.sigstore.dev/rekor/overview/) for transparency logs
- For production environments, consider implementing a more robust key management strategy
- Use [Fulcio](https://docs.sigstore.dev/fulcio/overview/) for certificate management

## Conclusion

This is a good step for a single user or process to sign and verify artifacts, but I don't talk about how this process would work in a **larger** ecosystem (next post). For pipelining work, in the next post, I will talk about emphemeral keypairs, environment-specific keys, and multi-step key-signing with application teams and platform/distribution teams.

Signing your Helm charts and Docker images with Cosign provides an additional layer of security to your supply chain. It helps ensure the integrity and authenticity of your artifacts, making it harder for malicious actors to inject compromised code into your deployments.

Remember that signing is just one part of a comprehensive supply chain security strategy. Combine it with other security measures like vulnerability scanning, access control, and regular updates for the best results.
